        <p>Leaders at all levels are responsible for their own learning while supporting their subordinates&#x2019; development. Every Marine is either a leader or a future leader, whether by rank or by their experience and influence on others. Therefore, Marines must lead by example in seeking learning opportunities for themselves, as well as for their Marines.</p>
        <p>An excellent way to master a topic is to endeavor to teach it well to other Marines. All Marines can develop leadership skills and improve communication skills through learning. Marines succeed with leadership styles that provide clear intent through mission-type orders and decentralized execution. Marines hold a special relationship with each other that is akin to the relationships of mature siblings&#x2014;they build each other up, share experiences, and hold each other accountable. This relationship begins with shared experiences in entry-level training and instills a shared understanding of honor, tradition, and the importance of leadership.</p>

        <p>Learning is necessary to leadership&#x2014;strong leaders promote learning in subordinates. Leaders recognize that the higher they progress, the more time that they must devote to leading others&#x2014;including others&#x2019; learning experiences. At the same time, leaders recognize that learning is critical to their responsibilities at higher levels. This situation creates a dissonance&#x2014;leaders at higher levels recognize the greater need to learn, but they often perceive that they have less time to do so. Therefore, the Marine Corps instills learning as a priority so Marines always look for opportunities to learn as much as they can, in a variety of ways, whatever their current situation or grade, in whatever time they have available. This situation reinforces the requirement to start the learning process as early as possible to ensure that it continues throughout every Marine&#x2019;s career.</p>

        <p>Leaders foster learning by engaging their Marines, taking interest in their well-being, and supporting their professional development. Leaders are justifiably proud when their Marines succeed; conversely, leaders help them overcome mistakes when they struggle. In combat, subordinates must assume responsibility when their leaders become casualties. It is the responsibility of leaders, therefore, to mentor and develop the next generation of Marine leaders to prepare them to assume greater leadership roles. Leaders do not wait for mistakes or failures to highlight a learning opportunity. Instead, they actively identify learning opportunities as they lead Marines in everyday duties so that their Marines learn to identify future learning opportunities on their own&#x2014;and will be more apt to identify learning opportunities for their own Marines as they move up in rank and position. Leaders provide subordinates with sufficient freedom of action to learn and develop without ceding responsibility to monitor, supervise, and correct subordinates&#x2019; actions when necessary. We cannot rightly expect subordinates to exercise boldness and initiative in the field when they are accustomed to being over-supervised in garrison.<a id="_idTextAnchor075"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor136"><span class="refLink sup-text">5</span></a> The goal is for Marines to seek learning opportunities on their own accord, even if the leader is not present.</p>

        <p>Teaching and leading cannot be uncoupled&#x2014;Marines who cannot teach will struggle as leaders. Strong leaders do not berate a subordinate for making the first mistake; they turn mistakes into teachable moments. Leaders encourage Marines to pursue learning opportunities and cultivate open dialogue to discuss lessons learned when mistakes are made. It is the leader&#x2019;s responsibility to recognize, act on, and correct the mistakes by turning them into learning opportunities, understanding that it is far better to learn in a training environment than to make mistakes when <a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>deployed. </p>

        <p>For example, providing topic areas for discussion using the Socratic method&#x2014;asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking, draw out ideas, and identify underlying assumptions&#x2014;during debriefs, rather than simply criticizing Marines&#x2019; actions, can be much more effective in fostering learning. Constructive, positive feedback makes learners aware of what they did correctly, reinforces desired behaviors, and identifies areas to improve. Negative feedback that unnecessarily tears a Marine down seldom leads to effective learning and can stifle initiative. </p>

        <p>	The path to mastery starts with a sense of humility&#x2014;Marines recognize that they do not know everything, and therefore, must remain humble as they pursue greater understanding and competence. Marines should always recognize that there will be more to learn and they must embrace their curiosity in order to continuously learn. Curiosity will lead Marines to the knowledge required to fill their own gaps in experience and improve their skill sets. </p>
        <p>When a Marine begins to feel more confident, it is because he or she is closing the gaps between their goals and their actual capabilities. Reaching a goal along the path to mastery is an indication that it is time to move on to a more challenging goal.</p>

        <p>Marines begin their pursuit of mastery by developing &#x201C;brilliance in the basics&#x201D; of technical and tactical proficiency. At all levels, technical and tactical proficiency requires Marines to reflect upon what they have learned, identify learning gaps, and close them. Self-reflection enables Marines to evaluate the quality of their practice, recognizing that deliberate, purposeful, quality practice leads to mastery. Incorrect practice and lack of focus does not lead to perfection; it leads to negative training that could be transferred to the battlespace. Marines focus on doing the basics correctly, building speed and agility.</p>

        <p>There are many technical skills that Marines learn&#x2014;some are standard battle skills training, and others vary across military occupational specialties. Marines build foundational technical skills such as marksmanship and operating as part of a team in entry-level training. Marines learn to be technically proficient as riflemen, which provides a common identity among all Marines. The larger lesson for all Marines to learn is the hard work, dedication, and persistence required when seeking self-improvement. Marines build on this lesson as they move on to the next technical challenge.</p>

        <p>Technical and tactical skills grow more complex as Marines advance in rank and experience&#x2014;requiring self-study, learning from peers, leaders, mentors, and advanced training and education. Technical skills also grow more advanced and complex as Marines assume responsibility for more advanced functions (e.g., maintenance quality control) and lead a larger number of Marines. Similarly, tactical skills progress based upon whether a Marine is leading a fire team, squad, platoon, company, or battalion. Marines must continuously build their technical and tactical proficiency at their current level while also preparing for the next level and leading or mentoring those at more junior levels. Leaders model this mindset and reinforce these skills for their subordinates and teams.</p>

        <p>Teamwork is required to accomplish military missions, combining the coordinated, sustained, and successful execution of individual and collective skills. Learning opportunities arise in the interactions between leaders and individual Marines, as well as between Marines and their peers as they work in teams. Marines develop teamwork and competencies so that they are technically and tactically proficient as individuals, teams, units, and MAGTFs. Collective learning experiences build teamwork that enables success. Teamwork building exercises provide the opportunity for Marine leaders to both lead the development of their Marines&#x2019; teamwork and learn from these exercises. During these learning activities, leaders who demonstrate humility by discussing what they did and why with subordinates reinforce learning at all levels of the team. Learning takes time, dedication, and diligence in the pursuit of mastery. This is true from the simple skill of correcting a rifle malfunction to the complex skill of applying tactics in the battlespace. All warfighting skills, from basic to advanced, require dedication to continuous learning. Leaders set the tone for this dedication to learning, collective skill development, and teamwork to accomplish missions.</p>

        <p>Strong leaders are also teachers and mentors. Every Marine is a current or future leader, and therefore, leads by example to seek learning opportunities for themselves and other Marines. All Marines develop leadership skills and improve communication through continuous learning and self-reflection. A strong leader turns mistakes into learning opportunities for those that they lead. Leaders encourage open discussion about how thoughts and actions contribute to outcomes, compared to simply pointing out mistakes for the Marines to improve upon. Leaders set the example by pursuing continuous professional development and career-long learning. The learning leader helps the next generation of Marines to become continuous learners. </p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch4-eagle-globe-and-anchor_1000_px.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>All Marines, especially those in positions of leadership, should strive to remain humble so they are ready and willing to learn from anyone, at any time, in any place. Marines have a tradition of passing on expertise, values, ethics, and experiences to the next generation. Marines reflect upon these vicarious experiences and integrate them with their own personal learning experiences to develop greater wisdom, which is essential for success in the profession of arms. </p>
        <p>Learning is an institutional priority and a professional expectation for all Marines. Continuous, disciplined, and progressive learning is necessary for warfighting readiness. Our profession demands that Marines focus on learning to become competent in weapons systems and tactics. The Marines Corps must also foster a culture of learning, understand their own Service culture, those of other Services and allies, the human dimension of the operational environment, and the cultures of those that we operate among. Marines leverage the art and science of learning, along with helpful technologies, to enhance and adapt learning environments to reflect the changing operational environment, tailor learning experiences, and provide constructive feedback. Leaders actively seek opportunities to model, foster, and encourage learning, both for themselves and for the Marines in their charge. The learning leader is a key enabler for Marines to develop competencies to operate effectively as teams, units, and MAGTFs.</p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch4-officer_1000px.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>Learning is the foundation for all that Marines do&#x2014;it is the key enabler for all warfighting functions and our purpose as the Nation&#x2019;s naval expeditionary force-in-readiness. From the first moment at entry-level training to our final days in the Corps, Marines have the professional responsibility to learn and to pass on lessons to other Marines. Marines learn to quickly recognize and understand important information, adapt, make sound decisions, and act&#x2014;which is especially important in the fog and friction of war. All Marines must understand that continuous learning is a priority and key to our readiness as the Nation&#x2019;s first line of defense, always being ready to be the first to fight. </p>
