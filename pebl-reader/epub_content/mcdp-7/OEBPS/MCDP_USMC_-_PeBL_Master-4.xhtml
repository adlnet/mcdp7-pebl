        <p>Warfighting is the most complex, challenging, violent, and dynamic human endeavor. The Marine Corps, as the Nation&#x2019;s force-in-readiness, must have the versatility and flexibility to effectively fight&#x2014;<span class="em-text">and succeed</span>&#x2014;in any situation and at any intensity across the full spectrum of conflict, whenever and wherever the Nation calls. To meet these demands, it is critical that Marines recognize that learning has a direct impact on warfighting. Marines who understand the key learning principles and continuously seek opportunities to develop knowledge, skills, and the proper attitudes throughout their careers will develop wisdom that enables success in battle. As Marines, we pass on our wisdom and experiences to the next generation of Marines. For the Marine Corps to remain the United States&#x2019; force-in-readiness, it is critical that every Marine strengthen and value learning in all facets of Marine Corps culture, learning environments, and leadership development. Learning is a professional responsibility for all Marines at all levels. Marines must develop the habit of continuous learning early in their careers to set the conditions for success in increasing levels of responsibility. </p>

        <p>Learning encompasses both training and education, which are equally important and complementary. A simple explanation of the differences between training and education is that training prepares Marines to deal with the known factors of war (e.g., the importance of good marksmanship), while education prepares Marines to deal with the unknown factors (e.g., effective decision-making in changing circumstances). Training and education are accomplished in different ways, but they are both required&#x2014;working together&#x2014;to instill the learning that results in readiness and effectiveness. </p>

Marines learn to address complex problems and develop teamwork wherever they may be, whether in garrison, deployed, or in formal learning centers. Learning enables Marines to think critically, develop judgment, and cultivate a bias for action without waiting to be told what to do. A Marine with knowledge and skills who lacks judgment requires close supervision, which may not be possible in combat conditions. Our Marine Corps ethos demands competence, responsibility, loyalty, and self-discipline as military professionals charged with the defense of the Nation. Learning prepares Marines to exercise initiative within the commander&#x2019;s intent&#x2014;constantly seeking to improve, develop mental agility, and deal with changing situations.</p>

        <p>A central tenet of maneuver warfare is attacking the enemy&#x2019;s ability to make decisions and to shift the mental aspects of warfare to the Marines&#x2019; advantage.<a id="_idTextAnchor014"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor103"><span id="_footnote1-8" class="refLink sup-text">8</span></a> In short, Marines develop an intellectual edge by learning cognitive skills and competencies that enable them to move through the <span class="em-text">observe, orient, decide,</span> and <span class="em-text">act </span>cycle, often referred to as the OODA loop,<a id="_idTextAnchor015"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104"><span id="_footnote1-9" class="refLink sup-text">9</span></a> more quickly and effectively than the enemy. The warfighter who recognizes what is happening, adapts to the situation, and then makes effective decisions in the shortest amount of time will typically have an advantage. The OODA loop decision-making cycle is even more important in preparation for future conflicts because as new technologies emerge the rate of change will continue to increase. Therefore, Marines must continuously improve their knowledge and skills by leveraging technology&#x2014;but never depend upon technology alone as the solution. Marines should <span class="em-text">observe</span> their environment to recognize key cues, synthesize these cues to <span class="em-text">orient</span> and quickly make sense of the information in order to <span class="em-text">decide</span> and <span class="em-text">act</span>&#x2014;and then Marines will start the cycle again as they observe the effects of their actions. Importantly, action includes Marines effectively communicating decisions to their teams. Marines use skills such as critical thinking, reasoning, viewing situations from multiple perspectives, and visualizing the battlespace in nonlinear terms to determine the best course of action within operational and tactical time constraints.</p>

        <p>Through progressive learning and experience, Marines at all levels develop a bias for action enabled by adaptive, rapid decision-making. The more Marines learn and exercise this bias for action, the better it becomes. Although war games or training exercises approximate the conditions of war, Marines cannot fully replicate the dangers, complexity, emotions, and friction of actual combat. Marines experience a variety of training situations that approximate combat situations so that learned experiences can be remembered and applied during the stresses and friction of combat. Through both direct and indirect experiences, Marines develop a realistic appreciation for what is possible in combat and what is not. The following vignette, based upon a composite of Marines&#x2019; experiences during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, illustrates the importance of learning from previous experiences and adapting to changing conditions.</p>
        <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-2">
            <div id="_idContainer017" class="box-style epub-Text-Box">
                <p>A Marine infantry company commander recognized in the first few days of an operation that the enemy was already anticipating and countering the unit&#x2019;s tactics. After assessing the information about the enemy&#x2019;s actions from several of the foot-mobile patrols, the commander concluded that the unit needed improved mobility and firepower to outmaneuver the enemy. The company commander spoke with the battalion commander and recommended attaching gun vehicles from the battalion&#x2019;s weapons company to work directly with the infantry company, providing a highly mobile force with increased firepower to augment the foot patrols. The company commander task-organized the weapons company detachment to provide additional infantry for close-in operations in the area&#x2019;s constricted terrain. This created an entirely different tactical plan for the company based upon observing the enemy&#x2019;s behaviors, adapting, and quickly learning from Marines&#x2019; experiences.</p>
                <p>The highly mobile elements of the company began to appear unexpectedly, surprising enemy units who believed they were attacking only foot-mobile patrols. As the enemy attempted to adjust to the new Marine tactics, the company commander continued to learn and adapt, making adjustments accordingly. For example, when the enemy began trying to set ambushes for the vehicle-mounted elements, the enemy would instead encounter well-planned ambushes by foot-mobile elements at critical junctions along their route of march. The company&#x2019;s mounted and foot-mobile elements continued to appear at critical locations again and again, repeatedly catching the enemy off guard and defeating their tactics. </p>
                <p>From the perspective of the enemy, the infantry company had become an overwhelming, omniscient, and omnipresent Marine Corps unit&#x2014;and the enemy ended all operations in the area. The actual situation was not Marine omnipresence, but rather an attentive and learning-focused Marine company who observed the enemy&#x2019;s behaviors, quickly learned to identify key cues and recognize patterns, and continuously developed new ways to adapt the company&#x2019;s tactics&#x2014;to outthink and overwhelm an enemy who failed to do the same. The company repeatedly put the enemy on the horns of a dilemma, convincing the enemy that success could not be achieved in the Marine company&#x2019;s area of operations.</p>

        <p>Marines need to develop memory skills because Marines&#x2014;as human beings&#x2014;increasingly tend to digitally store and search for information rather than committing the information to short-term or long-term memory. Marines cannot always rely on technologies or on being able to digitally search for information during combat due to many reasons, such as time constraints, lack of network access, or the need to minimize electronic signatures. Therefore, Marines at all levels need to train their minds to memorize and recall important information, to reflect upon that knowledge to develop understanding, and to frequently exercise these skills through training so that information can be recalled instinctively during combat.</p>

                <p>A Marine&#x2019;s mindset, values, ethics, and experiences impact his or her learning, decisions, and actions. &#x201C;Character, will, and intellect, they&#x2019;re interrelated, and they&#x2019;re inextricably linked. Now character is about moral character, and it&#x2019;s . . . about the capacity and the sense of the rightness of your decision: to be able to make that decision quickly. The will is about having the strength to execute the decision, and the intellect undergirds it all by giving you the context, the intellectual context, to be able to make the decision.&#x201D;<a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106"><span id="_footnote1-11" class="refLink sup-text">11</span></a> When Marines are aware of how perspectives and experiences shape their thinking, they can better identify assumptions, biases, and other factors that influence learning.

                <p>Marines have a professional responsibility to learn throughout their careers and should always seek opportunities to learn. Marines must take an active role in learning, be intellectually curious, and look for new ways to adapt what they have learned to other relevant situations. There are many factors that indicate a person&#x2019;s willingness and readiness to learn, such as physical, behavioral, social, emotional, and cognitive skills. Additionally, humility, courage, integrity, perseverance, motivation, and discipline are other key qualities that affect learning readiness. Marines increase their learning readiness by having the courage, perseverance, and discipline to continuously seek new professional knowledge, skills, and experiences. A Marine&#x2019;s learning can be facilitated by developing an awareness and understanding of one&#x2019;s own thought processes.<a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109"><span id="_footnote1-13" class="refLink sup-text">13</span></a> Marines sharpen their intellect by studying <span class="em-text">how</span> to think better and then applying these skills to improve as learners, leaders, and decision makers.</p>

                <p>When Marines understand why they are learning concepts and skills, they better understand the importance of learning to the mission and are more motivated to learn. By understanding the context of learning, Marines are better able to apply concepts and skills to new situations, increasing their competence and adaptability. Unknowns, uncertainty, and disorder will never be eliminated in battle&#x2014;information may be unclear, misinterpreted, influenced by the enemy, or communications systems may fail.

                <p>One cannot learn without feedback&#x2014;it is critical to learning and developing adaptability. There are two sources of feedback: intrinsic sources (i.e., internal) and extrinsic sources (i.e., external). For example, a Marine&#x2019;s own perception that he or she jerked the trigger when shooting a rifle, then adjusting the trigger pull on the next shot, would be an example of using intrinsic feedback. In this same example, extrinsic feedback would be a marksmanship instructor identifying the error to the Marine, then demonstrating the proper trigger pull. Both intrinsic and extrinsic feedback are important for learning and developing adaptability. <span class="em-text">Adaptability</span> is the quality of being able to adjust to new conditions. Marines develop adaptability when they examine a situation, recognize what is happening, and adjust their response to the new conditions. The process of learning is itself a form of adaptive behavior and is an essential element of combat effectiveness.<a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span id="_footnote1-14" class="refLink sup-text">14</span></a> Marines adapt to the operational environment, to changes in their assigned mission, to the enemy&#x2019;s adaptive tactics, and to changes in the civil component. Seeking and responding to feedback are critical to effective adaptation. All Marines can learn to become more adaptive through training, education, and self-study.</p>

                <p>Learning has specific goals and measurable objectives to gauge progress toward developing competencies. Marine learning is team-oriented so that Marines develop the skills and connections to fight collectively, usually as part of a Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF). Marines are challenged with problems that they tackle as teams in order to learn by doing (i.e., experiential learning) as well as from each other. Marine learning is focused on developing professional competence&#x2014;developing ready Marines and units capable of operating effectively in changing conditions. Additionally, Marines study history and world events to be more prepared to respond to new challenges, such as the increase in globalization and competition for resources. Effective warfighters adapt to fluid changes in circumstances in order to deal with complex problems and to proactively shape events for an advantage. Marines sometimes conceptualize the enemy and/or adversary as a single person or group of people, but should be viewed as a complex system. Marines must understand that the enemy and/or adversary may be comprised of many people, systems, and networks, founded on different ideologies. Through purpose-driven learning, Marines develop a variety of competencies to better understand and respond to complex enemy or adversary systems. Learning environments that simulate these complex systems develop Marines&#x2019; professional competence and encourage adaptation, as well as the ability to outthink enemies and/or adversaries in changing situations.</p>

        <p>Conflict is a human phenomena; understanding human nature helps Marines to understand conflict. Marines prepare for the complexities of each conflict by studying social, economic, political, cultural, environmental, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors. These factors often exert a greater influence on the character and outcome of war than do factors, such as the size of the enemy formations or their equipment. Marines learn as much as possible about the different human factors, cultures, perspectives, and ideas that impact operations. Developing self-awareness of the personal factors that can detract from learning, such as hubris (i.e., ego) and bias, enables Marines to overcome friction. Marines strive to view situations and information objectively and unemotionally, provide candid feedback to each other, and learn to overcome or mitigate factors that negatively impact preparedness.</p>

        <p>Violence and danger will always be parts of war. Learning to fight in dangerous conditions despite fear and uncertainty is key to warfighting. Marines of all ranks must understand how the body and mind respond to fear and stress so that they better control their responses in any situation, including combat. Marines learn how to effectively control stress reactions and fight in dangerous conditions through realistic training, increasing self-awareness, understanding the attributes of war, and increasing mental and physical resilience. </p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch1-danger.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>For example, Marines learn breathing techniques during marksmanship training to better control how the body&#x2019;s nervous system responds to stress in order to shoot more accurately. The breathing techniques help Marines to control their heart rate, respiration, attention, and muscles under stress, which then increases the accuracy of their fire. Combat can challenge unit cohesion and present Marines with a variety of moral and ethical dilemmas. Marines develop strong mental, moral, spiritual, and ethical understanding because they are as important as physical skills when operating in the violence of combat.</p>

        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch1-danielhaack.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>The science of learning encompasses many disciplines, such as neuroscience, psychology, and andragogy (adult learning).<a id="_idTextAnchor023"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor111"><span id="_footnote1-15" class="refLink sup-text">15</span></a> The human brain is a constantly reorganizing system capable of being shaped and reshaped across an entire lifespan. Each new learning event impacts the brain, regardless of the Marine&#x2019;s age, rank, or level of experience. Therefore, all Marines should understand that challenging experiences enhance the brain and better hone their warfighting capability. Science has also identified that individuals and teams have differences in the way they learn, with varying sensory preferences for learning,<a id="_idTextAnchor024"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112"><span id="_footnote1-16" class="refLink sup-text">16</span></a> competencies, and strengths. These differences are essential components of the learning process and can be useful knowledge for structuring or engaging in learning events so that learning is more effective. Prior experiences, knowledge, competencies, and perspectives are all unique elements that form the basis for understanding new information. Marines form relevant connections between new information and their prior knowledge. Adult learning involves adapting or modifying the prior relevant information to the specific situation or problem that the Marine seeks to resolve. Understanding the human dimension and science of learning enables Marines to tailor training and education to more effectively build competencies, learn from mistakes, provide effective feedback, and sustain learning. </p>
        <p>An effective way that Marines can accelerate their learning is by indirectly learning from others through <span class="em-text">vicarious experience</span>. Vicarious experiences are relevant learning opportunities that each Marine obtains by observing, reading, and studying what others have experienced. For example, Marines obtain vicarious experiences from observing others in their unit performing a task during an exercise, participating in after action reviews, reading lessons learned reports, or studying history. There is no excuse for not learning from others. </p>

        <p>The science of learning, combined with the art of learning, helps to develop well-trained and educated Marines and well-trained and combat ready units. Each Marine must learn <span class="em-text">how</span> to learn, both independently and collectively in teams. Social and interpersonal factors, such as effective communication, group cohesion, and trust, all influence learning. When these factors are positive, they facilitate the learning process and create strong relationships. Marines should actively seek to understand human and environmental factors that influence learning while avoiding thoughts and behaviors that can negatively affect learning and cohesion. This knowledge of the human dimension of learning and their own experiences lead Marines to develop wisdom that facilitates effective decision-making, which is often the determining factor in the battlespace.</p>

        <p>As Marines, we continuously seek and use information to solve problems. As information becomes more ubiquitous, it is increasingly challenging to determine how and what to focus on in order to make sense of information. The more often that Marines identify key cues and information during peacetime experiences, the more quickly that Marines are able to decide and act when deployed. Although each Marine views the world and problems through his or her unique perspective, every Marine develops common problem-solving skills. Quickly recognizing and addressing potential problems enables Marines to better deal with disruption and respond to changes in the enemy situation. With deliberate practice, Marines improve key skills such as recognizing patterns, filtering important information, critical thinking, and reasoning. The future battlespace will contain increasingly difficult problems that do not necessarily have a &#x201C;right&#x201D; answer. Therefore, Marines&#x2019; skills to observe objectively, reason effectively, take decisive action, and then adjust as needed remain key elements of success.</p>

        <h2 id="_idParaDest-10" class="subtitle">1.6 <a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>The Mind as a Weapon</h2>
        <p>The philosophy of maneuver warfare guides much of what Marines do&#x2014;it is their way of thinking about and preparing for war with the intended purpose of taking decisive action against the enemy at the least cost to themselves. Marines study and apply maneuver warfare in order to better exploit advantages in multiple domains and create rapidly unfolding situations in battle that overwhelm the enemy. Maneuver warfare requires that Marines develop the temperament to persevere amidst uncertainty and the mental agility to succeed in fluid and chaotic situations. Additionally, it requires being able to understand the dynamic and complex situation from multiple perspectives to determine how to exploit an advantage. Decentralized execution within the commander&#x2019;s intent is central to maneuver warfare; this requires that each Marine understand the situation and execute actions to support and achieve that intent.</p>
        <p>Regardless of technology and equipment, Marines are ready to fight and win. Therefore, it is essential that Marines develop and maintain an intellectual edge over any enemy by developing their minds; just as they would prepare any other weapon system for battle. This intellectual edge must come from self-disciplined study and deliberate practice as Marines to build competencies in the profession of arms&#x2014;as individuals, teams, units, and MAGTFs. </p>

        <p>Developing the mind as a weapon is a career-long process. Marines are continuous learners&#x2014;they pursue mastery in the profession of arms, recognizing that the achievement of mastery is a journey, not a destination. As adult learners, Marines recognize that they are responsible for their own learning outcomes, actions, and decisions.<a id="_idTextAnchor030"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114"><span id="_footnote1-18" class="refLink sup-text">18</span></a><span class="sup-text"> </span>Marines continuously seek to build their expertise and understand the context of what they are learning so that they can apply it effectively in new situations. Marines leverage their own unique personal experiences, as well as the experiences of others, as foundations to increase their understanding. </p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch1-jacksonsuminski.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>As adult learners, Marines need to know <span class="em-text">why</span> content is relevant during both training and educational activities. Marines perceive learning as a progression of goals to build competencies, not a single discrete goal. Therefore, Marines benefit most from information and learning activities presented in the context of real-life situations or task-specific problems.

Marines make sense of the information and build mental connections between their personal and vicarious experiences. As a result, Marines build individual and collective knowledge over time that enables them to understand different situations and other peoples&#x2019; perspectives, informing how to accomplish missions in changing situations.</p>
        <p>To become better warfighters, Marines continuously gather information and engage in activities that test their assumptions, develop new knowledge, increase critical thinking and reasoning, and build deeper understanding. Instead of simply asking <span class="em-text">what</span> happened in a battle, Marines should always ask and seek to better understand <span class="em-text">why</span> the events happened, and consequently what to apply for future situations. Marines must learn about a broad range of topics and skills through professional reading, experiential learning, and deliberate practice. Marines must also approach each event and interaction as a learning opportunity. There is always something to learn; even if that something is what <span class="em-text">not</span> to do in the future. As continuous learners, Marines actively seek, apply, and share lessons learned to develop themselves and other Marines in the profession of arms.</p>

        <h2 id="_idParaDest-12" class="subtitle">1.8 <a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Marines learn the concept of every <span class="em-text">Marine a rifleman</span> early in their careers. As Marines prepare for the complexities and volatility of future operating environments, they also recognize that&#x2014;for effective warfighting&#x2014;every Marine must also be a continuous learner. Marines continuously build and hone the skills needed to fight our Nation&#x2019;s battles, wherever and whenever they may occur. Marines are a naval expeditionary force-in-readiness&#x2014;and are career-long students of the profession of arms. Marines leverage the human dimension and science of learning in training and education. Marines learn in the classroom, learn in the field, learn in everyday life, and learn in combat. Marines adapt every tool that they have&#x2014;weapons, equipment, and their minds&#x2014;to succeed and <span class="em-text">win</span> in every clime and place. Marines must develop and demonstrate brilliance in the basic fundamental skills, combined with the mental agility to adapt to whatever situation they face. The Marine Corps is a thinking force that constantly strives to improve and is never finished learning. To continuously improve, Marines take a focused, self-disciplined approach to career-long learning and instills a culture of learning throughout our Corps. </p>
