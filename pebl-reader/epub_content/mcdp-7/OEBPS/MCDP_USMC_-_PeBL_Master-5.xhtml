        <p>Ideas and methods can have a more significant impact on warfighting than weapon systems, technology, or organizational structures. Marine Corps philosophy and ideas are in our doctrine and operational concepts. As Marines, career-long learning about our profession provides a solid foundation for critical thinking that informs Marine Corps ideas, methods, and concepts. The Marine Corps&#x2019; learning culture fosters the attributes that every Marine needs to pursue, such as adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, active listening, and a bias for action. These attributes are guided by doctrine, while focusing on the overall objectives to succeed and win battles. The organizational learning culture is a key factor that supports and builds these components for warfighting proficiency.</p>
		
        <h2 id="_idParaDest-14" class="subtitle"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>2.1 Organizational Culture</h2>
        <p><span class="em-text">Organizational culture</span> consists of the underlying beliefs, assumptions, values, and ways Marines interact that contribute to an organization&#x2019;s unique social and psychological environment. The culture of an organization comes from its history, customs, beliefs, behaviors, and expectations. Culture also reflects how a group describes themselves, their beliefs, and their organization. The Marine Corps organizational culture includes the maneuver warfare philosophy, an expeditionary mindset, and the pursuit of mastery in the profession of arms, as well as Marine Corps customs, traditions, and legacy established by the Marines who served before us. The Marine Corps&#x2019; culture of learning instills these beliefs and values, beginning with turning civilians into Marines during entry-level training and schools, and continuing throughout Marines&#x2019; careers. Marines embrace learning to effectively instill fundamental warfighting skills, recognize when change is required, and then adapt effectively to the factors driving change. Honing an intellectual edge over the adversary requires that all Marines become continuous learners who contribute to a learning organization. Therefore, Marines must continuously strengthen their learning culture to support professional development for all Marines.</p>

        <p>The Marine Corps&#x2019; culture values action, responsibility, adaptability, and problem solving. Therefore, the Marines&#x2019; learning processes and culture develop and exercise these values. The Marine Corps&#x2019; hierarchical command structure and processes may at times be perceived as an obstacle to adaptability and learning. Although both are essential for the proper exercise of command and control, Marines must ensure that they do not set the conditions for unintended negative effects on learning that could negatively impact warfighting, such as discouraging Marines&#x2019; initiative, feedback, or problem solving. </p>

        <p>Institutional processes such as recruit training and formal schools set the conditions for a culture of learning. Commanders in the fleet reinforce those initial processes, setting the conditions for a culture of learning that encourages Marines&#x2019; adaptability, problem solving, initiative, reasoning, and innovation, while maintaining structure, discipline, and readiness. Commanders set conditions that foster a culture of learning within units, and it is each individual Marine&#x2019;s responsibility to learn in those conditions. Marine Corps leaders at all levels must prioritize learning for themselves and their subordinates so that all Marines are ready for any challenge. A key Marine Corps leadership principle is to set the example; therefore, leaders set the example for learning. Doing so encourages Marines to develop critical knowledge, competencies, and thinking skills that the Marine Corps needs to fight and win our Nation&#x2019;s future battles.</p>

Commanders will appropriately prioritize learning opportunities so that Marines of all ranks engage in meaningful professional development and progress in the profession of arms. Leaders of Marines must dedicate time and effort to learning, and prioritize mental fitness as much as physical fitness. For example, Marines can integrate learning activities into physical fitness training activities&#x2014;stations can be set up along a run to demonstrate competence on a variety of tasks and equipment, such as using a radio, reporting specific items that are seen along the path, or demonstrating an understanding of different concepts (e.g., rules of engagement). Integrating learning activities into physical training events when Marines are both mentally and physically challenged encourages deep learning and facilitates the recall of lessons learned during combat situations.</p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch2-recruit.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>As part of the learning experience, leaders must foster an environment that appropriately tolerates mistakes, errors, and challenges to existing ideas. Challenging ideas and making mistakes are part of the learning process. Challenging ideas in a respectful and constructive way contributes to improved learning for both subordinates and leaders. Leaders should permit ideas to be challenged in discussion and planning, up to the point where the leader makes the decision. Leaders should not automatically interpret a subordinate challenging an idea or providing feedback as challenging their authority. The leader&#x2019;s authority gives him or her the responsibility to make decisions, but it does not mean that leaders have to develop all of the ideas themselves.</p>

        <p>Subordinates need to be willing to admit mistakes, ask questions, and seek corrective feedback. Naturally, &#x201C;a subordinate&#x2019;s willingness to admit mistakes depends on the commander&#x2019;s willingness to tolerate them.&#x201D;<a id="_idTextAnchor040"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><span id="_footnote2-4" class="refLink sup-text">4</span></a> Mistakes in training environments create opportunities for leaders to provide feedback essential for their subordinates&#x2019; learning, and therefore, helps prevent Marines from making the same mistakes in combat. At the same time, leaders need to have enough humility to admit that they, too, have made mistakes. Leaders should discuss mistakes, explain why they happened, and share the lessons learned with subordinates. It must be recognized that within an environment of appropriate safety measures, Marines will learn from their mistakes when they receive constructive, corrective feedback. Learning from mistakes within a controlled environment is an effective way to reduce mistakes in combat, when the friction and fog of war makes even simple actions more difficult.</p>
        <p>A critical element of learning from mistakes is embracing an <span class="em-text">appropriate</span> level of risk. Combat is inherently dangerous and risky. However, the greatest mistake in combat could be an unwillingness to act from a fear of risk or a failure to adapt to the changing situation. Therefore, Marines should only take reasonable risks during training and learn to adapt to the changing situation. Leaders must recognize that part of the leadership role is to establish the standards for what kinds of risks are reasonable. All Marines, regardless of position or rank, must discuss what led to mistakes, take corrective action, and learn from them. Learning from mistakes is key to Marines learning to act decisively and effectively, while taking prudent risks.</p>

                <p><span class="bold-text">Lessons Learned From Belleau Wood</span></p>
                <p>The &#x201C;devil dogs&#x201D; from the 4th Marine Brigade, who fought at Belleau Wood in 1918, took advantage of opportunities to learn from others and adapt during the fighting. After the action, they analyzed and instituted additional changes. Captain John W. Thomason, Jr., who earned the Navy Cross during his service with 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, wrote about the 4th Marine Brigade. Reflecting on the need to modify formations and tactics, he recollected:</p>
                <p>Those were before the days of lavish maps, to which the Americans afterwards attained. There was one map to each company, exclusive property of the captain. Platoon commanders had a look at it&#x2014;&#x201C;You&#x2019;re here. The objective is a square patch of woods a kilometre and a half northwest, about. See?&#x2014;this. Form your platoons in four waves&#x2014;the guide will be right. Third Battalion is advancing their flank to conform. French on the left. . . .&#x201D; Platoons were formed in four waves, the attack formation taught by the French, a formation proved in trench warfare, where there was a short way to go, and you calculated on losing the first three waves and getting the fourth one to the objective.<a id="_idTextAnchor041"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor119"><span id="_footnote2-5" class="refLink sup-text">5</span></a></p>
                <p>After the first engagement, the Marines never used it again. It was a formation that simply accepted casualties, was not adapted for open warfare, and left formations rushing across open ground incredibly vulnerable. It did not take the Marines long to learn better and to adapt their tactics founded on sound basics learned during their training. Initial training made Marines adept at long-range marksmanship and close-in combat. Careful attention to the experiences of others highlighted both the advantages and disadvantages of trench warfare. The Marines recognized and overcame errors or omissions in map reading, orders dissemination, reconnaissance, and combined arms integration. During the fight for Belleau Wood, Marines learned and adapted as they fought. Unlike their initial use of the French formation, the final drive to secure Belleau Wood was achieved with close integration of maneuver with supporting artillery fire. </p>
                <p>After the war, Thomason studied both German and US Marine Corps records to analyze the lessons learned in Belleau Wood and other areas so that Marines could learn and reinforce these lessons during peacetime training, rather than during the deadly combat of war. Consequently, Marine training retains a focus on individual marksmanship, map reading, the troop leading steps, and the integration of combined arms to generate combat power. Marines&#x2019; use of MAGTFs employed so effectively since the 1960s was in part based on lessons learned at Belleau Wood regarding the importance of a sound foundation in the basics and integrated combined arms. Marines learned the value of learning and adaptation from the experience at Belleau Wood and other battlefields, further establishing the Marine Corps&#x2019; culture of learning.</p>

Ultimately, instructors are key to shaping Marines&#x2019; attitudes toward learning and are critical to improving Marine Corps readiness. </p>

                <p>Third, leaders at all levels are responsible for setting the conditions within the unit for the subordinates&#x2019; professional military learning and development. Command programs reflect the commander&#x2019;s thoughts regarding leadership, mentorship, commitment to warfighting proficiency, and unit cohesion. Commanders tailor the unit&#x2019;s learning breadth, scope, and specific experiences to best prepare Marines for assigned unit responsibilities and the mission, building both individual and collective skill sets.</p>

                <p>Finally, the Marine Corps as an institution demonstrates a focus and commitment to encouraging career-long learning by continuously refining learning methods and providing resources and opportunities for professional development. Key to this commitment is ensuring that incentives are structured to encourage this learning culture. The Marine Corps values learning for warfighting readiness and effectiveness, continuously seeking better ways to support these values within organizational structures, resources, policies, and practices. Marines recognize that learning is a vital element of ensuring readiness, effectiveness, and adaptability to changing situations. This culture of learning is enabled through the Marine Corps&#x2019; learning-oriented policies, programs, and institutional processes. A culture of learning prioritizes and is committed to continuous learning and professional development. </p>

        <p>Marines are expected to have initiative, self-discipline, and motivation to actively engage in learning opportunities on their own. Marines must take ownership of personal learning by creating specific professional goals. After assessing progress, Marines may adjust their goals so that they remain challenging. Conversely, if a Marine struggles to attain a goal by the date established, the goal may need to be adjusted to include additional interim steps, feedback, or a modified timeline. Establishing clear short-, mid-, and long-term goals enables Marines to plan a clear path toward professional development.</p>
        <p>Learning is a developmental process. Professional learning goals are generally process-oriented so that short- and mid-term goals lead to long-term ambitions. Each Marine should identify professional learning goals, establish a plan of action, seek feedback, and regularly assess his or her progress. Just as learning is continuous, Marines regularly review, revise, and hold each other accountable for their professional development goals. Individual goals and progress can be discussed with peers, mentors, leaders, and&#x2014;as appropriate&#x2014;with subordinates. Additionally, professional learning expectations rise with seniority. While junior Marines are generally introduced to specific topics, subjects, and expectations, more senior Marines are expected to independently broaden the scope of their learning to advance their expertise. Taking time to organize one&#x2019;s thoughts, reflect upon professional goals, challenge existing ideas, and process new information is important at <span class="em-text">every</span> level of the developmental process.</p>

        <p>Learning is also a process of professional growth; Marines demonstrate motivation and professionalism by cultivating a <span class="em-text">
            <i id="3c3420f2-4ca3-4715-b374-36f6270e6bf6" class="peblExtension" data-peblextension="hotword" data-hotword="growth mindset" data-hotwordtext="the belief that skills and abilities can be developed, rather that being fixed" data-theme="Inherit Global Theme"/>.</span><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><span id="_footnote2-6" class="refLink sup-text">6</span></a> Individuals with a growth mindset believe that effort and learning can change one&#x2019;s qualities&#x2014;leading to development and success. Marines with a growth mindset are willing to set goals and actively improve upon personal weaknesses or knowledge gaps to further develop their skills, knowledge, and competencies. Marines with a growth mindset seek challenges and feedback to better learn and test current skills, increasing their competencies. Marines understand that mistakes and feedback can signal a need to improve and that investing increased effort, time, and practice will further develop professional skills.</p>
        <p>Marines with a growth mindset understand that they have control over their individual learning, and that the additional effort pays off in developing the knowledge and skills to improve. Conversely, individuals with a fixed mindset believe that their qualities are innate and are interested in feedback only to confirm their abilities, avoiding feedback that indicates any perceived weaknesses. Avoiding feedback and having a fixed mindset leads to stagnation. Leaders, mentors, and instructors directly influence Marines&#x2019; mindsets through the learning climate that they establish and the feedback that they provide. When leaders, mentors, and instructors attribute Marines&#x2019; successes to preparation, effort, persistence, and practice, the Marines are more likely to develop a growth mindset that cultivates the intrinsic motivation to continue to improve as warfighters.</p>

                <p><span class="em-text">Intrinsic motivation</span> is driven by perceived internal rewards; that is, one is driven to engage in a behavior because it is satisfying. Leaders can cultivate this type of motivation within Marines by supporting the growth mindset, and individual Marines can sustain it throughout their careers. In this way, the Marine Corps culture of learning encourages commanders, leaders, instructors, teams, and individuals to all support intrinsic motivation for learning and self-improvement.</p>

        <p>The Marine Corps&#x2019; organizational culture itself must continue to change and adapt to enable effective learning. This requires that the Marine Corps continuously explore new ideas, rigorously assess their feasibility and effectiveness, and implement ideas that work. A learning organization develops new ideas, tests them, learns from both successes and failures, and always recognizes that what worked in past or present situations may not continue to work in the future. Therefore, the Marine Corps organizational culture recognizes that the process of learning is <span class="em-text">never </span>complete. </p>
        <p>Learning is a Marine Corps priority and is foundational to the Marine Corps&#x2019; culture of adaptability and competence in harsh expeditionary environments. While commanders are responsible for the development of their Marines, continuous learning as a facet of self-improvement remains a personal and professional responsibility of all Marines. Fortunately, there are many opportunities to encourage learning at all levels&#x2014;<span class="em-text">especially</span> for intrinsically-motivated learners.</p>

        <p>The Marine Corps culture supports continuous, career-long learning at all levels. Professional learning is a responsibility and journey that all Marines embark on from their first day as Marines. The Marine Corps, Marine leaders, commanders, instructors, and individual Marines all contribute to a culture of learning which cultivates the belief that learning is a priority and an enabler for more effective warfighting. A culture that values continuous learning strengthens the desire for all to improve by setting clear goals and by learning from the past, while remaining open to new ideas and methods. </p>
        <p>All Marines can facilitate learning. As Marines develop in their careers, the responsibility to facilitate learning also increases. Marine Corps culture embraces learning as fundamental to Marine readiness&#x2014;to be the first to fight. Learning is essential to any profession, but it is particularly important to the Marines profession of arms, where the costs of not learning are so steep. </p>
