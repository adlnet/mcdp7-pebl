        <p>Victory does not necessarily go to those who have the largest or most modern forces, but to those who are able to recognize the need to adapt, generate intelligent decisions, and execute them more quickly than their enemy. This has proven true in the past and will assuredly continue into the future. As the Nation&#x2019;s naval expeditionary force-in-readiness, Marines create and foster learning environments that mirror the ways they fight and the threats that they will encounter. Marines must have many opportunities to learn in environments that realistically simulate the challenges Marines will encounter against capable adversaries across the full range of military operations. Effective learning opportunities, from simple reading assignments to field exercises, wargaming, and simulation training exercises, are critical to ensure that Marines experience realistic warfighting conditions, challenges, and complexity.</p>

        <p>In the progression of learning, training should provide Marines with an opposing will to practice against. Through repetitions in a training environment, Marines learn to outthink adversaries and overcome friction <span class="em-text">prior</span> to encountering these factors during real-world operations. Therefore, Marines integrate lessons learned from current and previous conflicts to adapt their learning environments, methods, assessments, and feedback to reflect evolving threats. In these learning environments, Marines can make mistakes, learn from them, adapt, and progress along a path to developing increased warfighting knowledge, skills, and competencies. Learning environments that are

        <p>The learning environment is much more than simply the physical space where learning occurs; it encompasses all the factors that influence instruction, such as methods, resources, technologies, culture, instructors, peers, and the social elements of learning. Developing warfighting skills and competencies requires time, deliberate practice, and repetition in operationally relevant contexts. There is not a single <span class="em-text">correct</span> design for creating the ideal learning environment because each learning objective, Marine, team, and condition will differ. Therefore, Marines modify the learning environment to most effectively meet the learners&#x2019; needs and reflect the conditions that they expect to encounter.

        <p>Effective learning requires environments that foster flexibility of thought, reasoning, and the creation of potential solutions to problems, and encourages Marines to explore alternative courses of action. At the same time, not all learning and decisions are based on analytical reasoning. Therefore, learning environments must also support Marines to make timely decisions and take action, including developing rapid experience-based decision-making such as recognition primed decision-making<a id="_idTextAnchor050"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><span id="_footnote3-3" class="refLink sup-text">3</span></a> and other forms of nonanalytical reasoning. Above all else, the learning environment is intended to aid the leader, instructor, mentor, or facilitator in creating conditions that are favorable to the desired learning outcomes for the learner.</p>
        <p>Instructors and leaders determine the specific instructional methods to use based upon the intended learning outcomes, the learners&#x2019; level of expertise and experience, the available tools and resources (including time), and the instructors and leaders experience. Instructors and leaders should select the most effective method in order to achieve the intended learning outcome. They should employ a variety of learning methods, recognizing that methods that are effective for one instructor, leader, schoolhouse, or learning outcome may not be effective for others. Learning environments are regularly assessed and adjusted as needed so that they remain appropriate for the intended learning objectives. An effective learning environment enables Marines to clearly understand the intended warfighting doctrine, concepts, tactics, techniques, procedures, and learning outcomes. It clearly identifies the expectations for the learners&#x2014;whether exercising Marines&#x2019; critical thinking and problem-solving skills or understanding circumstances where immediate obedience to orders or application of specific basic skills (such as good marksmanship) are required. Additionally, effective learning environments provide opportunities for Marines to execute the required repetitions under different conditions to achieve competency. First and foremost, the learning environment focuses on the learners&#x2019; needs, enabling Marines to understand, develop, and retain the necessary knowledge and competencies they will use in combat.</p>

        <p>There are many proven and effective traditional instructional methods; however, leaders and instructors must remain open to exploring new evidence-informed methods to improve Marines&#x2019; learning environments so that they can have multiple ways to develop competencies. When considering whether to replace or enhance existing instructional methods, instructors and unit leaders must first seek clear evidence that a new method is, in fact, better than the existing methods. Marines do not hastily adopt a new method simply because it is new; rather, Marines assess its value to support learning relative to their existing methods. Marines are open to exploring and adopting new methods when they are demonstrably better, not just because they are new.</p>

Terrain models are among the earliest tools used by military tacticians and strategists to visualize the physical environment. STEXs prepare Marines for tactical and strategic command. They stress the importance of &#x201C;top sight,&#x201D; the ability to see how individual pieces of the problem fit into and affect the whole.&quot;,&quot;A tactical walk is a time-constrained exercise that requires participants to devise, express, and defend a solution to a tactical problem. The physical setting is a major element of the exercise, and students literally explore it as part of the walk. In so doing, students gain firsthand experience about how terrain influences operational performance.&quot;,&quot;In Tactical Decision Games (TDGs), Marines devise a tactical response to a given scenario. Students may express their solutions as written orders and corresponding map diagrams, and/or they may verbally disseminate their solutions as if they were issuing orders.&quot;,&quot;A case is an exercise in which students devise and discuss practical solutions to a real problem faced by an actual person at some point in the past. Decision-forcing cases (DFCs) look at the problem from the point of view of the protagonist&#x2014;the actual person who lived the historic event.&quot;,&quot;Simulations are replications of situations and systems. Frequently, when personnel talk about simulators, they often mean computer-based simulators, such as flight simulators. The Marine Corps owns and operates a number of these simulators, and they support instruction for a wide variety of technical areas, including tactical air, ground, surface, and subsurface actions; medical skills training; and strategic planning.&quot;,&quot;VR systems use more complex computer-based systems, and they include specialized input devices (e.g., virtual rifles or realistic cockpit &#x201C;joysticks&#x201D;) instead of a standard keyboard and mouse.&quot;,&quot;Integrated simulators are the most complex simulator systems. They combine computerized control and feedback with articulated, responsive physical models. For instance, integrated ship simulators include robust physics models and corresponding motion platforms, allowing them to accurately respond to any maneuvers the captain makes and replicate the physical sensations. The USMC&#x2019;s Supporting Arms Virtual Trainer is an integrated simulator.&quot;,&quot;Simulated environments combine several of the previously mentioned types of simulators in a realistic settings. Simulated environments typically consist of pre-scripted scenarios, actors, props, full-sized integrated simulators, and monitoring devices (e.g., video and audio recording). These systems allow students to blend all of their skills, practice working under non-ideal conditions, and do so in a safe and educational setting.&quot;]" id="ce20cc6b-6262-4ae2-af7a-fac78684f448" data-zoomable="true" data-theme="Inherit Global Theme"/>

        <p>Although Marines strive for learning efficiencies, improving the learning environment does not necessarily mean making it more efficient. For example, although rote memorization or reciting facts can be very efficient and useful for developing basic knowledge, such as memorizing standing orders, they are not effective methods for all learning. Effective learning often requires approaching material from different perspectives, applying information in context, and explaining <span class="em-text">how</span> and <span class="em-text">why</span> actions occurred, in addition to <span class="em-text">what</span> occurred.</p>

        <p>The concepts of <span class="em-text">surfaces</span> and <span class="em-text">gaps</span>&#x2014;from a warfighting perspective&#x2014;are discussed in MCDP 1. Put simply, surfaces are hard spots (i.e., enemy strengths) and gaps are soft spots (i.e., enemy weaknesses). Just as Marines study the enemy&#x2019;s surfaces and gaps, Marines must study their own. Having done this, Marines then tailor the learning environment and approach to accelerate learning. For the Marine learner, <span class="em-text">surfaces</span> are areas of existing understanding&#x2014;strongpoints that Marines maintain, build upon, and relate&#x2014;while <span class="em-text">gaps</span> are areas of weaknesses in knowledge, experience, or competencies&#x2014;areas that the instructor and the learner need to fill with new understanding and practice. The same is true of Marine Corps units. While focusing on addressing the learning gaps, Marines also ensure that surfaces do not deteriorate over time. Furthermore, learning environments help reveal individual barriers to effective learning that can lead to gaps, such as personal ego, inexperience, and bias. Open discussion and quality after action reviews provide opportunities for Marines to reflect upon their experiences and internalize new concepts to fill these learning gaps and reinforce learning surfaces.</p>
        <p>Recognizing these surfaces and gaps requires awareness, honesty, and judgment because they are often unique to the individual or the specific unit&#x2014;a surface in one learner or unit may be a gap in another. It is incumbent upon leaders, instructors, learners, and their peers to &#x201C;actively seek out [these] gaps [through] continuous and aggressive reconnaissance&#x201D;<a id="_idTextAnchor053"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor124"><span id="_footnote3-4" class="refLink sup-text">4</span></a> (i.e., self-assessment). Learners should not hide gaps in their knowledge&#x2014;instead, they should exercise intellectual humility to identify and fill these gaps in order to improve. Marines mitigate weaknesses by leveraging their strengths (i.e., surfaces) to form new understanding and focus on learning to eliminate the gaps. This can only occur when learners first acknowledge their weaknesses and resolve to leverage their strengths to build meaningful connections.</p>

		<h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="subtitle">3.3 <a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>The Expeditionary Nature of Learning</h2>
        <p>Expeditionary warfighting is the primary focus of Marine learning; therefore, learning environments should reflect expeditionary operations. Although much of a Marine&#x2019;s initial training occurs in schools, learning continues throughout a Marine&#x2019;s career and often occurs outside of formal settings. Consequently, learning is adapted to the specific individual and unit context, mission, and operational conditions. Marines recognize that to be effective warfighters, they must be warrior-scholars&#x2014;they must seize the initiative to study the profession of arms whenever and wherever learning opportunities arise. </p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch3-forsvaret.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>Aside from instructors in formal schools, Marines learn from leaders, mentors, peers, subordinates, professional reading, field exercises, in garrison, and aboard ship. Marines learn about warfighting through on-the-job activities, discussions with other Marines, interactions with the members of other Services and allied forces, and <span class="em-text">all</span> their experiences. For example, Marine units may discuss tactics while traveling to conduct an operation, learning during mission rehearsal and preparation. Additionally, Marines can use downtime while aboard ship to conduct simulation training, complete professional reading, conduct tactical decision games, rehearse unit standing operating procedures, and discuss warfighting vignettes. Marines seek and seize opportunities for learning in any clime and place.</p>

                <p class="bold-text">Force-on-Force Exercises to Simulate War&#x2019;s Complexity</p>
                <p>Force-on-force exercises are purpose-driven learning environments that approximate the complexity of war. For example, a red force can be scripted to use the enemy&#x2019;s anticipated tactics to test the Marines&#x2019; level of &#x201C;brilliance in the basics&#x201D; at applying tactics, techniques, and procedures against an expected foe. Additionally, the red force could follow enemy strategy and tactics, but also adapt to blue force actions. A third option might employ complete free play between two opposing forces&#x2014;whether in live field training or in other learning activities, such as a war game&#x2014;to allow both forces to exercise better unit tactics and combined arms operations. All of these approaches have a purpose and application&#x2014;from exercising the basics to fighting against a thinking, adaptive peer competitor.</p>
                <p>When developing such exercises, Marines focus on designs that enhance problem solving and promote decision-forcing events. This enables Marines to practice and better understand how to get inside the enemy&#x2019;s decision-making process. The training provides difficult situations that simulate operations as realistically as possible, requiring that Marines confront dilemmas and experience the increased stress that may impact unit cohesion during combat. There is no substitute for fighting against a competent, realistic, thinking, adaptive enemy&#x2014;even if that enemy is simulated by other Marines. This practice ensures that challenging learning environments provide a place to practice, develop experience, allow errors, adapt, and learn how to <span class="em-text">fight and win</span>.</p>

        <p>Throughout history, technology has advanced and tactics have evolved to address increasing complexity. Regardless of technology, Marines need to adapt and deal with complex problems faster than their enemies by exploiting expeditionary learning environments and developing an expeditionary mindset&#x2014;that is, a readiness to exploit learning opportunities at any time, in any place. Marines guard against complacency because they know that their adversaries are always watching what the Marines are doing and are constantly making changes to adapt in an attempt to defeat us. If Marines settle for what they think is &#x201C;good enough,&#x201D; it may result in high casualties in the next fight. Just as every Marine is a rifleman regardless of their duties and military occupational specialty, every Marine is also part of an expeditionary learning organization, ready to recognize changing conditions and adapt <a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>accordingly.</p>

The main effort receives priority for support and becomes the harmonizing force for all subordinate initiatives. For a learning environment to be effective, the learner must be the main focus of effort. Therefore, whether at the individual or collective level, the learning environment focuses on the learners&#x2014;individuals, teams, units, and MAGTFs&#x2014;as the main focus of effort. Leaders and instructors are always in support of the learner.</p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch3-rappel.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>Marine leaders and instructors shall recognize the importance of understanding learners&#x2019; needs, interests, and abilities in order to inspire, challenge, and motivate their Marines. The learner-centric model tailors the learning delivery methods to be most effective for the learners, rather than defaulting to a &#x201C;one-size-fits-all&#x201D; instructional approach. When faced with a decision, ask &#x201C;<span class="em-text">how can I best support the main focus of effort: the learner</span>?&#x201D; Marines will be more engaged and enthusiastic about learning when the methods are adjusted for their aptitudes. Learners need opportunities to work at their own pace, and&#x2014;when appropriate&#x2014;to explore areas that they find useful or interesting. </p>

        <p>Decentralized learning provides learners with multiple opportunities to follow their curiosity to develop professionally. The learner-centric model ensures that content is relevant to learners, actively engaging and challenging Marines in a positive instructional climate. For example, discussions on problem solving between the learners and leaders and instructors are an effective method to motivate learners and build teams as they analyze information, consider alternatives, and work together to develop a solution to the problem posed to them. This method is often characterized by 
        <i id="f463b14d-4c2e-4f33-986f-1ef210d4a322" class="peblExtension" data-peblextension="hotword" data-hotword="active learning" data-hotwordtext="an approach to instruction that centers the learner as an active participant, instead of a passive receiver of knowledge" data-theme="Inherit Global Theme"/> through the creation of follow-on questions that further define and solve the problem. This fosters an engaging learner-centric environment and critical thinking and challenges Marines to develop alternative solutions. </p>
        <p>The goal of a learner-centric environment is to help learners make connections between prior knowledge and newly presented material. As described in the first chapter, adult learners use their current knowledge as a basis when they gain new knowledge. Marines learn differently, in different ways, and/or at different speeds. To facilitate these connections, leaders and instructors must know their Marines and become familiar with their strengths, weaknesses, needs, and interests. This familiarity enables establishing a learning environment that can introduce, reinforce, sustain, and evaluate essential behaviors that are vital to mission success. Additionally, leaders and instructors can involve learners in tailoring the learning environment and content to make learning more engaging. Although adaptive curriculum may not be suited for entry-level training and schools, it can be effective at intermediate and advanced schools. While each Marine is individually responsible for learning, Marine Corps commanders, leaders, mentors, and instructors establish the conditions for success.</p>

        <h2 id="_idParaDest-23" class="subtitle">3.5 <a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Self-Directed Learning</h2>
        <p>Self-directed learning is the process in which individuals take the initiative in identifying their learning needs, formulating goals, pursuing these goals, and evaluating outcomes.<a id="_idTextAnchor059"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor127"><span id="_footnote3-7" class="refLink sup-text">7</span></a> Although self-directed learning begins with the learner, it requires support and guidance from commanders, leaders, mentors, and instructors. When appropriate, encouraging and holding Marines accountable for self-directed learning increases and sustains professional curiosity. The idea of self-directed learning is similar to <span class="em-text">mission tactics</span>&#x2014;assigning a subordinate a mission without specifying how the mission must be accomplished.<a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128"><span id="_footnote3-8" class="refLink sup-text">8</span></a> In MCDP 1, leaders are encouraged to leave the manner of accomplishing the mission to their subordinates, thereby allowing a subordinate to have freedom (and establishing the duty) to determine and take the necessary steps to accomplish the mission based on the specific situation. Mission tactics rely on a subordinate&#x2019;s exercise of initiative framed by proper guidance and understanding; the same principle applies to self-directed learning.</p>
        <p><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/ch3-bonfacioaueluafilitaula.jpg" alt=""/></p>
        <p>Like mission tactics, self-directed learning benefits the leader and instructor by giving the learner more ownership and autonomy, which enables the leader or instructor to focus on learners who need more help or to explore alternate ways to improve the learning environment. The commander, leader, instructor, or mentor agrees to provide the learners with the necessary support and guidance to help them accomplish their missions without unnecessarily prescribing their actions. The learner is then responsible for devising and executing a plan of action that meets the prescribed guidance, exercising proper judgement and initiative. Self-directed learning encourages learners to develop a desire to learn, solve problems, and ask questions. Self-directed learning also enables critical thinking and reasoning, encouraging Marines to consider content credibility, sources of information, and alternate perspectives. As learners progress to higher levels, self-directed learning becomes both more effective and necessary for developing the intellectual edge that contributes to team, unit, and MAGTF effectiveness.</p>

        <p>An effective and simple way to conduct self-directed learning can be through vicarious experience&#x2014;learning from others&#x2019; experiences, as discussed in chapter 1. This method is even more important in our profession than in others because Marines cannot always actually practice every variation prior to combat. For example, vicarious learning can be most effective when Marines reflect upon what they have either read or observed&#x2014;how others acted and adapted&#x2014;so they become better prepared for future challenges.<a id="_idTextAnchor060"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><span id="_footnote3-9" class="refLink sup-text">9</span></a> </p>
        <p>Vicarious experience is critical because even the most realistic training experiences and military education fall short of the reality of combat. Therefore, the more vicarious experience that a Marine obtains, the less likely that a new experience, in combat or otherwise, will be completely unique. Having many personal and vicarious experiences to draw upon gives Marines a stronger foundation to adjust during unanticipated circumstances. <span class="em-text">Mental imagery</span>, which is a person&#x2019;s visualizations or mental representations, can also be helpful for obtaining vicarious experiences. Marines can use mental imagery to gain confidence prior to executing a skill, emphasize key points in after action reviews, examine possible outcomes of decisions, and explore options. Mental imagery also provides an effective mission rehearsal technique. When using mental imagery, a leader pictures himself or herself in the operation, vividly visualizes different scenarios, including possible branches and sequels, and rehearses the decisions he or she may make given specific conditions and enemy actions. In this way, the leader mentally prepares for multiple potential enemy actions and reduces the possibility of surprise when the enemy reacts. </p>

        <p>Regardless of location or position, Marine instructors are knowledgeable, skilled, competent, and confident in their abilities. They know their Marines&#x2019; strengths and weaknesses and empathize with the learners&#x2019; challenges to better understand how they can tailor the learning environment to be more effective. Instructors also inspire learners to want to learn more by sharing their own experiences and explaining <span class="em-text">why</span> learning is important. Attracting, rewarding, and retaining a highly qualified cadre of effective instructors is a crucial factor in facilitating Marines&#x2019; learning and requires senior leaders to recognize the importance of learning. An appropriate focus on the selection processes is essential to select the right Marines as instructors, trainers, and educators. Therefore, the adage should be, &#x201C;those who can, do, and those who have done well, teach.&#x201D;<a id="_idTextAnchor063"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor131"><span id="_footnote3-11" class="refLink sup-text">11</span></a> </p>
        <p>The Marine Corps balances the rotation of the most knowledgeable and effective practitioners of the profession of arms between operational, instructional, and their own educational assignments so that more Marines can benefit from the experts&#x2019; wisdom and skills, while they are afforded the opportunity to sharpen their own. For example, expert instructors know when to apply specific instructional methods, when it is time to transition to more advanced techniques, how to provide constructive feedback, and how to facilitate critical thinking and creative problem solving. Instructors and leaders are the foundation of Marine learning and, by extension, of Marine readiness.</p>

        <p>Learning assessments facilitate and guide the learning process to determine whether the learner is proficient in required competencies. They serve as feedback tools for both the instructor and the learner, assessing the learner&#x2019;s progress and the instructor&#x2019;s effectiveness. The best assessment method for the situation varies based on the learning objective. There are many types of assessments; examples include <span class="em-text">diagnostic, formative,</span> and <span class="em-text">summative</span> assessments. </p>

        <p>Instructors use a range of assessments matched to the learning objectives. For example, diagnostic assessments may be initially helpful to understand the level of learners&#x2019; knowledge or skills before an educational or training event, whether individual or collective. Formative assessments are more process oriented; therefore, they can identify areas that need to be strengthened. At the end of a course or training event, summative assessments may be used to ensure that the learners meet a specified standard or have developed a competency, such as making effective decisions in tactical environments.</p>
        <p>Assessments are employed to provide learners with constructive feedback so that they can further develop professionally, rather than an arbitrary test score that does not capture growth or change.<a id="_idTextAnchor065"/><a href="MCDP_USMC_-_PeBL_Master-8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><span id="_footnote3-12" class="refLink sup-text">12</span></a> The most effective instructors use the coach-teach-mentor approach to provide learners with constructive feedback. Marine Corps assessments are honest, transparent, and constructive so that learners better understand how they are progressing. Feedback is most valuable when learners can quickly apply the information to develop new understanding, knowledge, and skills. Although errors, mistakes, and failures are never end states, they may occur as a necessary step in the learning development process. Learners and instructors alike should understand that Marines learn because of their errors, not despite them.</p>

        <p>Just as MCDP 1 confirms that war is a human enterprise and that no amount of technology can reduce the human dimension, the learning environment is also primarily based on human characteristics rather than equipment. Technology can support, expand, and individualize learning; it is one of many tools to support learning objectives. Some technologies also collect data on learner performance to enhance feedback and after-action reviews. Technology can facilitate individual and collective skill development, feedback on current performance, and supplemental instruction tailored to individual or unit needs. For example, Marines use simulations, both individually and collectively in teams, to train in calling for supporting arms. By simulating both the operational environment and command and control systems,

These repetitions are particularly valuable when live-fire ranges, training areas, equipment, or other assets are limited. Simulations can also introduce elements that cannot be easily or safely replicated in live training, such as the employment and effects of supporting arms.</p>

        <p>Marines integrate supporting learning technologies seamlessly into the learning environment to educate themselves, learn vicariously, and realistically train as they will fight. For example, Marines can use other technologies, such as audiobooks or videos, to supplement their reading. Likewise, instructors use technologies to monitor, conduct after action reviews, and facilitate individual learner&#x2019;s progress. Marines also select specific technologies to augment their learning environments based upon the learning purpose, conditions, and their needs. Marines thereby seek and employ a variety of learning methods and technologies, all focused on the desired learning outcomes.</p>

        <h2 id="_idParaDest-27" class="subtitle">3.9 <a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Battle is the ultimate test of military learning, and training as Marines will fight is a time-honored Marine Corps principle. In preparing for battle, Marines leverage the art and science of learning along with helpful technologies to enhance learning environments, tailor learning experiences, and provide constructive feedback to accelerate learning. Marines continuously assess and adapt the Marine Corps&#x2019; learning content, methods, exercises, and environments to ensure that they are relevant and effective. Additionally, Marines increase their capability by providing other Marines with the freedom to exercise initiative for their own learning, such as in self-directed learning. Marines design, create, and evolve their learning environments to increasingly challenge ourselves. Commanders, leaders, instructors, mentors, and coaches ensure that individual Marines and their units receive realistic learning experiences that closely simulate operational conditions. Marines purposefully design learning environments to ensure proper warfighting skill development at all levels&#x2014;individual, team, unit, and MAGTF.</p>
        <p>To be successful, Marines must engage in continuous learning and be able to apply the lessons learned. During the stresses of combat, Marines will fight the way that they learned. Therefore, all Marines must engage in disciplined, career-long continuous learning, including seeking opportunities to receive feedback to guide improvement. Marines understand why they are learning and how it will improve their professional competencies as warfighters. Learning and continuous professional development are expectations and opportunities for all Marines. </p>
